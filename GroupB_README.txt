Thi is data set for Figure 3 and others for the results of simulations in Group B
Results of 10,000 Monte-Carlo simulations

There are three separate data sets
GroupB_Antigen_only.d: results with antigen testing only
GroupB_PCR_only.d: results with PCR testing only
GroupB_Antigen_PCR.d: results with antigen testing and additional PCR testing

In all data sets, results are recorded as 
0 0 0 0 1 0
0 1 0 0 1 0
0 2 0 0 1 0
0 3 0 0 1 0
0 4 0 0 1 0
0 5 0 0 1 0
0 6 0 0 1 0
0 7 0 0 0 1
0 8 0 0 0 1
0 9 0 0 1 1
0 10 0 0 2 1
0 11 0 1 3 0
0 12 0 1 2 1
0 13 0 1 5 1
0 14 0 1 5 1
0 0 0 0 1 0

(continue)

The first value is a error rate for the tests. 0 means no error, and 1 means test fails for all specimen (means no tests)

The second number is the day for infectious dynamics. Since simulations for two weeks is carried out, 14 is the maximum. The day 0 to 14 is the results of one run for Mont-Carlo iterations. 

The third number is cumulated number of quarantined individuals by symptom confirmation.

The forth number is cumulated number of quarantined individuals by testing.

The fifith number is the number of exposed individuals. 

The sixth number is the number of all infected individuals except E. Average values of the numbers in GroupB_Antigen_PCR.d are used in Figure 3. 

By taking the average at each day of the data in GroupB_Antigen_PCR.d, and then applying Eq. 5, we have Fig. 4a. 
Figure 5 is the same results of Figure 4, and the contribution of each day of the occurrence of infected individual are shown.
Figure 6 is generated by the numbers in the third, forth sixth column.

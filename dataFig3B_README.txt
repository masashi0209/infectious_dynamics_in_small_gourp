The first number is the day to the next testing. 1 means tesing every day. 2 means testing every two days, and so on.

The second number is the day after the first infection. Max day is 14 under 2 weaks simulation.

The thid number is a number of quarantined infecteded individuals (cummulated number).

The fourth number is the number of infected individuals as exposed (E).

The fifth number is the number of infected individuals having infectability (either pre-symptomatic (P), infected and symptomatic (Is) or infected and asymptomatic (Ia))
